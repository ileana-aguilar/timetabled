# Calendar
Calendar is a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. 

## Here's how Calendar looks:
<img src='/timetableOverview.gif' title='Timetable Overview' width='' alt='Timetable Overview' />

# Features:
- A one-week calendar that includes one-hour time blocks
- Events have different titles
- Events have different colors based on their type
- Each events block has location of event



# Getting started:
## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Run the application in developer mode

```
npm run dev
```

## Open project in the browser

In the command line Vite will display a link, such as http://127.0.0.1:5173 to click on or copy/paste that will take you to the localhost port where the project is running.


Tip: If you'd like to stop the server, you can use ctrl + c or cmd + c within the Terminal, or use the trash can icon in the top right of the Terminal within VS Code. To run the server again, simply use npm run dev again.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
